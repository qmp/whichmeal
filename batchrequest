		"description":"A fricassee is a creamy dish often made at home with white meat (usually a whole chicken cut into eight pieces), vegetables, and a dense white sauce. Rabbit meat can be substituted for chicken for a similar flavor, as has been done in this recipe.",
		"lstIngredients":
		[
			"1 whole rabbit",
			"50g, 1.7 oz butter",
			"2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
			"2 teaspoon floor",
			"100g, 3.5oz bacon, chopped",
			"100g, 3.5 oz button mushrooms, cut into quarters",
			"4 shallots, cut in half",
			"4 celery sticks, diced",
			"2 carrots, diced",

			"2 garlic cloves, chopped",
			"4 sprigs of fresh thyme",
			"2 bay leaves",
			"50ml, 1.7 fl oz cream",
			"Salt and pepper for seasoning"
		],
		"recipe":"1. Divide the rabbit into 8 pieces. (You can ask your butcher to do this for you). \nIf you're concerned about the rabbit's tenderness, marinate the rabbit for one night in the pot first, and when you cook the rabbit, make sure that the heat isn't that high; this way the rabbit will definitely become softer and tastier.\n2. Season all the pieces of rabbit with salt and pepper, then lightly cover them in flour.\n3. Start heating the oil and the butter in the pan and then add the rabbit. Lightly cook over a moderate heat until golden brown.\n4. When light brown, remove the rabbit from the pan and leave to one side.\n5. Brown the bacon, then add the mushrooms, the shallots, the diced celery and the diced carrot and cook until slightly brown.\n6. Pour in the white wine and reduce it down to about half.\n7. Once the wine has reduced, put the rabbit back into the pot.\n8. While continuously stirring, add the stock to the pan.\n9. Finally, before cooking the dish thoroughly, add the garlic, bay leaves and thyme. Stir.\n10. Bring the stock to a gentle simmer, then skim off any scum that may have risen to the surface. Cover, lower the heat and cook, simmering for 1 hour.\n11. Spoon out the rabbit and the vegetables and place them onto a serving dish.\n12. For a delicious finishing touch, pour the cream into the sauce and reduce it down by about half. Here, also adjust the seasoning if necessary.\n13. Add some chopped parsley to the sauce, pour it over the rabbit and vegetables and serve immediately.\n Source : http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Rabbit-Fricassee"
